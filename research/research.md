# Compare and contrast three band websites from different genres
1. Alabama 3 https://www.alabama3.co.uk/
- genre sweet country acid house music
- pros things i like 
    - the single pixel bottom to indicate more scrolling
    - a simple vertical arrangement of information makes the site look good on all media
    - simple colour theme dark/light/dark/light/dark with red buttons and headlines in opposite
    - I like the transition used for the menu viz falls down from top
    - navbar is v simple
- cons
    - the menu is very big
    - not obviously alabama3 except for title

I think I'll be going for restrained and elegant - Iron maiden are definitely neither.
